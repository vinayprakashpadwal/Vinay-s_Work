Mention the differences between Data Mining and Data Profiling?
Data Mining	Data Profiting
Data mining is the process of discovering relevant information that has not yet been identified before.	Data profiling is done to evaluate a dataset for its uniqueness, logic, and consistency.
In data mining, raw data is converted into valuable information.	It cannot identify inaccurate or incorrect data values.
2. Define the term 'Data Wrangling in Data Analytics.
Data Wrangling is the process wherein raw data is cleaned, structured, and enriched into a desired usable format for better decision making. It involves discovering, structuring, cleaning, enriching, validating, and analyzing data. This process can turn and map out large amounts of data extracted from various sources into a more useful format. Techniques such as merging, grouping, concatenating, joining, and sorting are used to analyze the data. Thereafter it gets ready to be used with another dataset.

Data Analyst Interview Questions On Statistics
14. How can you handle missing values in a dataset?
This is one of the most frequently asked data analyst interview questions, and the interviewer expects you to give a detailed answer here, and not just the name of the methods. There are four methods to handle missing values in a dataset.
Listwise Deletion
In the listwise deletion method, an entire record is excluded from analysis if any single value is missing.
Average Imputation 
Take the average value of the other participants' responses and fill in the missing value.
Regression Substitution
You can use multiple-regression analyses to estimate a missing value.
Multiple Imputations
It creates plausible values based on the correlations for the missing data and then averages the simulated datasets by incorporating random errors in your predictions.
15. Explain the term Normal Distribution.
Normal Distribution refers to a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean. In a graph, normal distribution will appear as a bell curve.

* The mean, median, and mode are equal
* All of them are located in the center of the distribution
* 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean
* 95% of the data lies between two standard deviations of the mean
* 99.7% of the data lies between three standard deviations of the mean
16. What is Time Series analysis?
Time Series analysis is a statistical procedure that deals with the ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals. Time series data are collected at adjacent periods. So, there is a correlation between the observations. This feature distinguishes time-series data from cross-sectional data.
Below is an example of time-series data on coronavirus cases and its graph.

17. How is Overfitting different from Underfitting?
This is another frequently asked data analyst interview question, and you are expected to cover all the given differences!
	
	
	
	

18. How do you treat outliers in a dataset? 
An outlier is a data point that is distant from other similar points. They may be due to variability in the measurement or may indicate experimental errors. 
The graph depicted below shows there are three outliers in the dataset.

To deal with outliers, you can use the following four methods:
* Drop the outlier records
* Cap your outliers data
* Assign a new value
* Try a new transformation
19. What are the different types of Hypothesis testing?
Hypothesis testing is the procedure used by statisticians and scientists to accept or reject statistical hypotheses. There are mainly two types of hypothesis testing:
* Null hypothesis: It states that there is no relation between the predictor and outcome variables in the population. H0 denoted it.  
Example: There is no association between a patient’s BMI and diabetes.
* Alternative hypothesis: It states that there is some relation between the predictor and outcome variables in the population. It is denoted by H1.
Example: There could be an association between a patient’s BMI and diabetes.
20. Explain the Type I and Type II errors in Statistics?
In Hypothesis testing, a Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even if it is true. It is also known as a false positive.
A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected, even if it is false. It is also known as a false negative.
21. How would you handle missing data in a dataset?
Ans: The choice of handling technique depends on factors such as the amount and nature of missing data, the underlying analysis, and the assumptions made. It's crucial to exercise caution and carefully consider the implications of the chosen approach to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data analysis. However, a few solutions could be:
* removing the missing observations or variables
* imputation methods including, mean imputation (replacing missing values with the mean of the available data), median imputation (replacing missing values with the median), or regression imputation (predicting missing values based on regression models)
* sensitivity analysis 
22. Explain the concept of outlier detection and how you would identify outliers in a dataset.
Outlier detection is the process of identifying observations or data points that significantly deviate from the expected or normal behavior of a dataset. Outliers can be valuable sources of information or indications of anomalies, errors, or rare events.
It's important to note that outlier detection is not a definitive process, and the identified outliers should be further investigated to determine their validity and potential impact on the analysis or model. Outliers can be due to various reasons, including data entry errors, measurement errors, or genuinely anomalous observations, and each case requires careful consideration and interpretation.

27. What is the function to find the day of the week for a particular date value?
The get the day of the week, you can use the WEEKDAY() function.

The above function will return 6 as the result, i.e., 17th December is a Saturday.
28. How does the AND() function work in Excel?
AND() is a logical function that checks multiple conditions and returns TRUE or FALSE based on whether the conditions are met.
Syntax: AND(logica1,[logical2],[logical3]....)
In the below example, we are checking if the marks are greater than 45. The result will be true if the mark is >45, else it will be false.

29. Explain how VLOOKUP works in Excel?
VLOOKUP is used when you need to find things in a table or a range by row.
VLOOKUP accepts the following four parameters:
lookup_value - The value to look for in the first column of a table
table - The table from where you can extract value
col_index - The column from which to extract value
range_lookup - [optional] TRUE = approximate match (default). FALSE = exact match
Let’s understand VLOOKUP with an example.

If you wanted to find the department to which Stuart belongs to, you could use the VLOOKUP function as shown below:

Here, A11 cell has the lookup value, A2:E7 is the table array, 3 is the column index number with information about departments, and 0 is the range lookup. 
If you hit enter, it will return “Marketing”, indicating that Stuart is from the marketing department.
30. What function would you use to get the current date and time in Excel?
In Excel, you can use the TODAY() and NOW() function to get the current date and time.

31. Using the below sales table, calculate the total quantity sold by sales representatives whose name starts with A, and the cost of each item they have sold is greater than 10.

You can use the SUMIFS() function to find the total quantity.
For the Sales Rep column, you need to give the criteria as “A*” - meaning the name should start with the letter “A”. For the Cost each column, the criteria should be “>10” - meaning the cost of each item is greater than 10.

The result is 13.
33. Using the data given below, create a pivot table to find the total sales made by each sales representative for each item. Display the sales as % of the grand total.

* Select the entire table range, click on the Insert tab and choose PivotTable

* Select the table range and the worksheet where you want to place the pivot table

* Drag Sale total on to Values, and Sales Rep and Item on to Row Labels. It will give the sum of sales made by each representative for every item they have sold.

* Right-click on “Sum of Sale Total’ and expand Show Values As to select % of Grand Total.

* Below is the resultant pivot table.

35. What is the difference between a WHERE clause and a HAVING clause in SQL?
Answer all of the given differences when this data analyst interview question is asked, and also give out the syntax for each to prove your thorough knowledge to the interviewer.
	
	
	
	
Syntax of WHERE clause:
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Syntax of HAVING clause;
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s);
36. Is the below SQL query correct? If not, how will you rectify it?

The query stated above is incorrect as we cannot use the alias name while filtering data using the WHERE clause. It will throw an error.

37. How are Union, Intersect, and Except used in SQL?
The Union operator combines the output of two or more SELECT statements.
Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 UNION SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
Let’s consider the following example, where there are two tables - Region 1 and Region 2.

To get the unique records, we use Union.

The Intersect operator returns the common records that are the results of 2 or more SELECT statements.
Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 INTERSECT SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

The Except operator returns the uncommon records that are the results of 2 or more SELECT statements.
Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 EXCEPT SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

Below is the SQL query to return uncommon records from region 1.
38. What is a Subquery in SQL?
A Subquery in SQL is a query within another query. It is also known as a nested query or an inner query. Subqueries are used to enhance the data to be queried by the main query. 
It is of two types - Correlated and Non-Correlated Query.
Below is an example of a subquery that returns the name, email id, and phone number of an employee from Texas city.
SELECT name, email, phone
FROM employee
WHERE emp_id IN (
SELECT emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE city = 'Texas');

45. What do you understand by LOD in Tableau?
LOD in Tableau stands for Level of Detail. It is an expression that is used to execute complex queries involving many dimensions at the data sourcing level. Using LOD expression, you can find duplicate values, synchronize chart axes and create bins on aggregated data.
46. Can you discuss the process of feature selection and its importance in data analysis?
Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features from a larger set of variables or predictors in a dataset. It aims to improve model performance, reduce overfitting, enhance interpretability, and optimize computational efficiency. Here's an overview of the process and its importance:
Importance of Feature Selection:
- Improved Model Performance: By selecting the most relevant features, the model can focus on the most informative variables, leading to better predictive accuracy and generalization. - Overfitting Prevention: Including irrelevant or redundant features can lead to overfitting, where the model learns noise or specific patterns in the training data that do not generalize well to new data. Feature selection mitigates this risk. - Interpretability and Insights: A smaller set of selected features makes it easier to interpret and understand the model's results, facilitating insights and actionable conclusions. - Computational Efficiency: Working with a reduced set of features can significantly improve computational efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.
47. What are the different connection types in Tableau Software?
There are mainly 2 types of connections available in Tableau.
Extract: Extract is an image of the data that will be extracted from the data source and placed into the Tableau repository. This image(snapshot) can be refreshed periodically, fully, or incrementally.
Live: The live connection makes a direct connection to the data source. The data will be fetched straight from tables. So, data is always up to date and consistent. 
48. What are the different joins that Tableau provides?
Joins in Tableau work similarly to the SQL join statement. Below are the types of joins that Tableau supports:
* Left Outer Join
* Right Outer Join
* Full Outer Join
* Inner Join
49. What is a Gantt Chart in Tableau?
A Gantt chart in Tableau depicts the progress of value over the period, i.e., it shows the duration of events. It consists of bars along with the time axis. The Gantt chart is mostly used as a project management tool where each bar is a measure of a task in the project.
